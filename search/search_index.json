You will learn about a variety of patterns for integrating security-centric release control into AWS CodePipeline. Additionally, you will learn how to add feedback loops and fix common security vulnerabilities in your container-based applications. Level : Advanced Duration : 2 - 3 hours Prerequisites : AWS Account, Admin IAM User CSF Functions : Prevent, Detect CAF Components : Preventative, Detective AWS Services : Amazon CloudWatch , AWS CodeCommit , AWS CodeBuild , AWS CodePipeline , Amazon ECR , AWS Lambda , and AWS Security Hub Open Source Projects : Hadolint , Trufflehog , and Anchore Scenario Your company has just kicked off a new DevSecOps initiative in an effort to improve the security of critical applications by embedding security in every part of the software development lifecycle. You are part of a DevOps team tasked with integrating security testing into a rudimentary pipeline for building and releasing container images. Your initial tasks include adding Dockerfile linting, secrets scanning, and vulnerability scanning. The decision has been made to evaluate and make use of open source projects with the possibility of moving to a commercial offering based on how well the requirements are met. Architecture For this workshop you will start with a basic CI/CD pipeline that is triggered on Pull Requests and builds and pushes a container image to an Amazon ECR repository. As you work through the tasks in your latest sprint you'll end up with the CI/CD pipeline as shown below. It will include stages within your AWS CodePipeline for linting Dockerfiles, scanning for secrets, and scanning for vulnerabilities including an integration with AWS Security Hub. In addition you will be using a combination of Amazon CloudWatch Event Rules and AWS Lambda Functions to create feedback loops for each stage of security testing. This will allow your developers to quickly fix and iterate on their code which will lead to faster and more secure deliveries.

This module requires you to run two different AWS CloudFormation templates, which will automate the creation of the pipeline and Anchore service. You will then walk through each stage and manually configure the security testing. Deploy the Anchore service The first CloudFormation you run will create the Anchore vulnerability scanning service. Before you deploy the CloudFormation template feel free to view it here . Region Deploy US East 2 (Ohio) Click the Deploy to AWS button above. This will automatically take you to the console to run the template. The Specify an Amazon S3 template URL is already selected and the template URL is automatically added. Click Next . On the Specify Details click Next . On the Options click Next (leave everything on this page as the default). Finally, on the Review section acknowledge that the template will create IAM roles and CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND and click Create . What is CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND? Some templates contain macros. Macros perform custom processing on templates; this can include simple actions like find-and-replace operations, all the way to extensive transformations of entire templates. Because of this, users typically create a change set from the processed template, so that they can review the changes resulting from the macros before actually creating the stack. If your stack template contains one or more macros, and you choose to create a stack directly from the processed template, without first reviewing the resulting changes in a change set, you must acknowledge this capability. This will bring you back to the CloudFormation console. You can refresh the page to see the stack starting to create. Before moving on, make sure the stack is in a CREATE_COMPLETE status.

While going through each stage you will fix any misconfiguration or vulnerability so that your sample application is able to successfully passes through each stage and is pushed to AWS ECR. Pipeline Architecture Commit : Developer makes a commit to the Development branch. Pull Request : Developer makes a Pull Request Source Branch: Developement Destination Branch: Master Triggers Rule : A CloudWatch Event Rule is triggered based on the following events: pullRequestSourceBranchUpdated pullRequestCreated Invokes Function : The AWS Lambda Function is setup as a target for the CloudWatch Event Rule and it is invoked after the CloudWatch Event Rule is triggered Posts comment : The Lambda Function posts a comment to the Pull Request stating that the security testing is starting. Starts Pipeline : The Lambda Function starts the CodePipeline. Pull Request Stage : The stage pulls in these sources and stores them as artifacts in S3; CodeCommit repository: container-devsecops-wksp-app (development branch) CodeCommit repository: container-devsecops-wksp-config (master branch) Dockerfile Linting Stage : The stage pulls in the artifacts from S3 and uses Hadolint (build spec file and configuration file pulled in from S3) to lint the Dockerfile to ensure it adheres to best practices. Secrets Scanning Stage : The stage runs high signal regex checks directly against the CodeCommit Repository ( container-devsecops-wksp-app - development branch ) Vulnerability Scanning Stage : The stage builds the container image, pushes it to ECR, and triggers an Anchore vulnerability assessment against the image. If the scan results include any vulnerabilites that meet or exceed the threshold the build fails. If the vulnerabilites are lower than the threshold the CodeBuild project will invoke a Lambda function with the scan results as the payload and the Lambda function will push the vulnerabilites into AWS Security Hub for future triaging since the risk for those have been accepted. Publish Imaeg : The last stage builds the image using the destination commit hash as the tag and publishes it to AWS ECR. CodeBuild Triggers : If any CodeBuild Project fails a CloudWatch Event Rule is triggered. Triggers Lambda Function : The Lambda Function is setup as a target for the CloudWatch Event Rule and is invoked after the CloudWatch Event Rule is triggered. Adds Feedback to Pull Request : The Lambda Function takes the results from each stage and CodeBuild project and posts a comment back to the Pull Requst. This gives the developers fast feedback so they're able to fix any issues that are identified through the pipeline. Make a commit Now you can test your pipeline to see how your Pull Requests result with an image being built and pushed to AWS ECR. First, make a commit to the development branch of your sample application Within your Cloud9 IDE expand your sample application on the left side. Open the Dockerfile . Add a name to the Label line. Push your commit. cd /home/ec2-user/environment/sample-application git add Dockerfile git commit -m Modified Maintainer in Dockerfile git push -u origin development Create a Pull Request aws codecommit create-pull-request \\ --title Updated Maintainer \\ --description Please review these changes. \\ --targets repositoryName=container-devsecops-wksp-app,sourceReference=development,destinationReference=master Go to your AWS CodePipeline to view the progress and result. View the feedback loop Each time a stage is run the results of the CodeBuild Project are posted back to the Pull Request to act as a feedback loop for developers. Go to the CodeCommit console Click on the latest Pull Request. Click the Activity tab to view the feedback. Fix the Dockerfile linting defects In the feedback you should see multiple defects that were identified by the Dockerfile linting stage. The first defect can be fixed by modifying the hadolint configuration. Click on your Cloud9 IDE tab. In the left file tree, expand the container-devsecops-wksp-config folder and open hadolint.yml . Fix the defect: DL3026 : Use only an allowed registry in the FROM image Description : Using externally provided images can result in the same types of risks that external software traditionally has, such as introducing malware, leaking data, or including components with vulnerabilities. To prevent the use of externally provided images you should only pull images from trusted registries. Fix : Add - docker.io under trustedRegistries . Explanation : Since the image is pulling from Dockerhub we can include it on the list so that the build is able to pass. Adding Dockerhub is purely for testing purposes, in reality you would whitelist trusted registries that you host yourself or registries hosted by trusted 3rd parties. Reference : NIST SP 800-190: Application Container Security Guide - 3.1.5 Commit your configuration changes: cd /home/ec2-user/environment/container-devsecops-wksp-config git add . git commit -m Added a trusted registry to hadolint configuration. git push -u origin master The next two defects can be fixed by modifying the Dockerfile. In the left file tree, expand the sample-application folder and open Dockerfile . Fix the defects: DL3002 : Last USER should not be root. Description : To adhere the principals of least privileges, your containers should not be running as root. Most containerized processes are application services and therefore don\u2019t require root access. Fix : Change USER to a non privileged user. Add the following to the Dockerfile: RUN addgroup -S sasquatch RUN adduser -S sasquatch -G sasquatch Next, replace USER root with USER sasquatch Explanation : By creating a user in your Dockerfile, you are making it not only secure by default but also easier to keep secure. Reference : NIST SP 800-190: Application Container Security Guide - 3.1.2 DL3007 : Using latest is prone to errors if the image will ever update. Description : Latest is just a tag you add to an image and is no way dynamic. It can be overwritten and prove difficult to understand what version of the software is installed. Using the latest tag can effect the availability of your application and you should look at using a more explicit tag. Fix : Pin the version explicitly to a release tag. Replace FROM python:latest with FROM python:alpine3.7 Reference : NIST SP 800-190: Application Container Security Guide - 3.1.2 Commit your application source code changes: cd /home/ec2-user/environment/sample-application git add Dockerfile git commit -m Fixed Dockerfile linting issues. git push -u origin development View the Pull Request Feedback Updating the Pull Request branch automatically triggers the pipeline again. You can view the feedback to see if the defects were remediated. Go to the CodeCommit console Click on the latest Pull Request. Click the Activity tab to view the feedback. Remove secrets Based on the feedback you received in the Pull request you can see that secrets were identified in your code. Click on Logs in the comment or view the CodeBuild Project history to identify the secret and the file it is located in. How could you improve the feedback loop to make it easier for the developer? Remove the secret from the file. Modify trufflehog configuration Currently your trufflehog configuration is scanning through all of your commits to identify secrets. Since you'll be removing any current secrets you can modify the configuration to only scan new commits to speed up the build. In the left file tree, expand the container-devsecops-wksp-config folder and open buildspec_secrets.yml . Update your trufflehog configuration to only scan 1 commit deep. Change this command: - trufflehog --regex --rules secrets_config.json --entropy=False \"$APP_REPO_URL\" To this: - trufflehog --regex --rules secrets_config.json --entropy=False --max_depth 1 $APP_REPO_URL The second line adds \"--max-depth 1\" which limits the scan depth. Commit your configuration changes: cd /home/ec2-user/environment/container-devsecops-wksp-config git add . git commit -m Modifed max-depth in trufflehog command. git push -u origin master Commit your application changes: cd /home/ec2-user/environment/sample-application git add . git commit -m Removed access key. git push -u origin development View the Pull Request Feedback Updating the Pull Request branch automatically triggers the pipeline again. You can view the feedback to see if the defects were remediated. Go to the CodeCommit console Click on the latest Pull Request. Click the Activity tab to view the feedback. You'll notice that your pipeline is still failing on the secrets stage. If you look at the commit that's being scanned you'll see that the access key still exists in that commit because it is part of the diff. Make one more commit and you'll see that your build passes the secret scanning stage successfully. In the left file tree, expand the sample-application folder and open Dockerfile . Change the Label to the following: LABEL maintainer= Sasquatch version= 1.0 Commit your application source code changes: cd /home/ec2-user/environment/sample-application git add Dockerfile git commit -m Added version Label. git push -u origin development Secrets in source code Description : Many applications require secrets to enable communication with other serivces or backend components. When an application is packaged into an image, these secrets can be embedded directly into the image. This creates a security risk in which anyone with access to the image can easily obtain the secrets. Fix : Remove secrets from source code and leverage a secure solution for managing secrets like AWS Secrets Manager or AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store . **Explanation: Best practice is to the remove secrets from all previous commits and rotate any credential found but due to time constraints you removed the secret and modified the scanning tool to only scan new commits. Reference : NIST SP 800-190: Application Container Security Guide - 3.1.4 View the Pull Request Feedback Updating the Pull Request branch automatically triggers the pipeline again. You can view the feedback to see if the defects were remediated. Go to the CodeCommit console Click on the latest Pull Request. Click the Activity tab to view the feedback. View vulnerabilities In the feedback you should see information regarding any vulnerabilities that were found in the image. When you went through the environment setup you specified a vulnerability threshold of \"High\" , which means that the build will fail if an image contains any High or Critical vulnerabilities. Specifying a threshold allows you to put in a place a risk tolerance for different severities of vulnerabilities. This allows your developers to continue to move quickly with low risk vulnerabilities that can be triaged and fixed later on. In the current setup, all vulnerabilities below the threshold will be pushed to AWS Security Hub. Since the build passed the vulnerability analysis stage we can assume that any low or medium finding was pushed to Security Hub. Click on the Security Hub link in the Pull Request feedback. Click Findings in the left navigation Click the search field and select a fileter of Product Name EQUALS Default . The resulting findings are all of the vulnerabilities found in the image. View Image The last stage of the pipeline builds the image, publishes it to AWS ECR, and then merges athe Pull Request. You'll see in the feedback that a message is posted regarding the outcome of this stage and you'll notice that the Pull Request has been merged. Go to the CodeCommit console Click on the latest Pull Request. Click the Activity tab to view the feedback. Click the AWS ECR repository link. Following tagging best practices, your image is tagged with the Git commit hash of your application. Congratulations! You've completed the Integrating security into your container pipeline workshop.

Before sending us a pull request, please ensure that: You are working against the latest source on the master branch. You check existing open, and recently merged, pull requests to make sure someone else hasn't addressed the problem already. You open an issue to discuss any significant work - we would hate for your time to be wasted. To send us a pull request, please: Fork the repository. Modify the source; please focus on the specific change you are contributing. If you also reformat all the code, it will be hard for us to focus on your change. Ensure local tests pass. Commit to your fork using clear commit messages. Send us a pull request, answering any default questions in the pull request interface. Pay attention to any automated CI failures reported in the pull request, and stay involved in the conversation.
